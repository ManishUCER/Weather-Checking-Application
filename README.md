# Weather-Checking-Application
This app allows users to check real-time weather conditions by entering a city name. It fetches data from WeatherAPI and displays:
✅ Temperature 🌡️
✅ Weather condition ⛅
✅ Humidity 💧
✅ Wind Speed 🌬️
I built it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a modern and responsive UI. The project was a great learning experience in API integration and front-end design!
